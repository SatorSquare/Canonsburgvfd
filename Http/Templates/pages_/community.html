        <p>
            We are heavily involved in the local community. In partnership with the North Strabane Fire Department, we visit various schools within the 
            Canon-McMillan School District to educate students in grades K-5th on fire prevention. We also offer tours of the fire hall and open our doors several 
            times a year for field trips by local daycares and scouting groups.<br /><br />
            
            A question that often comes up in the community is car seat inspections, which we do not do on site, but residents can call the Canonsburg Police 
            Department at <a href="tel:{{POLICE_PHONE_RAW}}"><u>{{POLICE_PHONE_READABLE}}</u></a> to schedule an inspection.<br /><br />
            
            We work hand-in-hand with local media to spread awareness and education and report on incidents and emergencies.<br /><br />
